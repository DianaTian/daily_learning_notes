## 特殊字符
- caret ^ => startswith 以某字符开头
- period . => any single character 一个任意字符（换行符除外）
- \S => 非空白字符
eg: \S+ => 至少一个非空白字符
- square brackets [] => 一个字符类，匹配方括号内指定的任意一个字符

## 量词
一般跟在一个通配符后面，表示前面通配符的数量
- asterisk * 作为量词，表示其前面的字符可以出现0次或多次
- plus + 作为量词，表示其前面的字符可以出现1次或多次

eg: 

.* 匹配任意数量（包括零个）的任意字符

.+ 匹配至少一个任意字符

## 方法
- re.findall('reg', string)

找到所有的匹配项，返回列表，没有则为空列表
- re.search('reg', string)

只找第一个匹配项，没有则为None

## 圆括号 parentheses
( ) When parentheses are added to a regular expression, they are ignored for the purpose of matching, but allow you to extract a particular subset of the matched string rather than the whole string when using findall().



## 示例-筛选邮箱
- re.findall('\S+@\S+',  line)
- re.findall('[a-zA-Z0-9]\S*@\S*[a-zA-Z]', line)
- re.search('^X\S*: [0-9.]+', line)

> We are looking for substrings that start with a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or number “[a-zA-Z0-9]”, followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\S*), followed by an at-sign, followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\S*), followed by an uppercase or lowercase letter. 

## 示例
`^X-.*: [0-9.]+`
> We want lines that start with X-, followed by zero or more characters (.*), followed by a colon (:) and then a space. After the space we are looking for one or more characters that are either a digit (0-9) or a period, "[0-9.]+". Note that inside the square brackets, the period matches an actual period.

> Note: Inside square brackets, characters are not “special”. So when we say [0-9.], it really means digits or a period. Outside of square brackets, a period is the “wild-card” character and matches any character. Inside square brackets, the period is a period.


## 总结
^ Matches the beginning of the line.
注意：如果^ 放在[]里的最前面，表示取反的意思，比如 [^ ] 表示一个非空格字符。

$ Matches the end of the line.

. Matches any character (a wildcard).

\s Matches a whitespace character， 包含空格、制表符\t、换页符\f、换行符\n以及其他一些 Unicode 空白字符。

\S Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \s).

\* Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times.

*? Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times in “non-greedy mode”.

\+ Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times.

+? Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times in “non-greedy mode”.

? Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time.
? non-greedy matching 非贪婪匹配（正则表达式中*和+默认贪婪匹配，尽量匹配最长的字符串，加上？后表示最小匹配即可）

?? Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time in “non-greedy mode”.

[aeiou] Matches a single character as long as that character is in the specified set. In this example, it would match “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, or “u”, but no other characters.

[a-z0-9] You can specify ranges of characters using the minus sign. This example is a single character that must be a lowercase letter or a digit.

[^A-Za-z] When the first character in the set notation is a caret, it inverts the logic. This example matches a single character that is anything other than an uppercase or lowercase letter.

( ) When parentheses are added to a regular expression, they are ignored for the purpose of matching, but allow you to extract a particular subset of the matched string rather than the whole string when using findall().
( Indicates where string extraction is to start
) Indicates where string extraction is to end

\b Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.

\B Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.

\d Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].

\D Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to the set [^0-9].
